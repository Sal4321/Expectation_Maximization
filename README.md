# Expectation_Maximization
Project on Expectation Maximization done in Fall Semester

The goal of the project was to compare the effectiveness of Expectation-maximization algorithm on different parameter setting of the mixture distributions. I changed mean, variance  of
each of mixture distributions and analyzed how quickly EM algorithm was able to converge, in addition to this I calculated accuracy of the predictions by using Adjusted Rand score. 
The project distribution is inside Project4.docx file where the mdethodologies and results are described
